Once upon a time, there lived 3 dwarves. They were all ambitious. They want to be the best forgers in the world. However, they have a lot to learn. So then their journey begins.
They figured the first step to improving in their trade would be to consult the current forging experts. So, they began their journey headed toward the residence of Raphael Gilbert, who had made his home in an active volcano. They all admired him for this commitment to his trade and were excited to study at the feet of this master. Though a forging genius, Raphael was an ill-tempered man. Rumors of his cruelty were abundant. But, The dwarves knew that to be truly great, they would have to suffer through this. 
Much like the great Mr. Miyagi, Raphael made the 3 dwarves complete  many odd tasks in their journey to become the best. First, the dwarves were told to dive into the deepest depths of their world's ocean in search of a special pearl. Raphael informed them that there would be a lot of danger in this quest, so he told them that this was an important test in evaluating their skills and mettle. In order to face these dangers and find the pearl, the 3 dwarves had to create their own equipment.
